        <h2 class="mb-6 text-3xl font-semibold">How We Collect Your Data</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">We collect data in the following ways:</p>
        <ul class="pl-5 mb-16 space-y-3 list-disc list-outside">
          <li class="pl-2">
            <strong class="font-bold">Directly from You:</strong>
            We collect data directly from you when you take actions such as
            creating an account, subscribing to services, or engaging with us
            through support channels or feedback forms. This direct collection
            ensures that we have accurate information to create and manage your
            account, tailor services to your needs, and communicate effectively
            with you regarding updates, features, or support matters. When you
            actively provide data—whether inputting details during registration,
            sending an inquiry, or responding to surveys—it empowers us to offer
            a more personalized experience and address your needs more
            effectively. Collecting data directly from users also enhances the
            trustworthiness of our system by confirming that the information is

            interact with our services, allowing us to understand your usage

            collection can include details such as app interactions, feature
            usage, or session durations, which help us analyze how our platform
            is used and identify areas for improvement. However, to protect your
            privacy and maintain transparency, we do not use cookies or
            third-party analytics tools that could track your activity across
            different sites or services. This approach prioritizes user privacy
            and ensures that any automatic data collection is limited to the
            operations within our platform, focusing solely on enhancing your

          Legal Basis for Data Processing

          commitment to transparency and user autonomy. By choosing to use our
          services, you agree to the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy,
          which includes the collection, processing, and storage of your data
          for the purposes described. This consent-based approach ensures that
          you have control over your information and are informed about how it
          is being used. We obtain your explicit agreement at the point of
          registration or interaction with our platform, giving you the choice

          have the right to withdraw it at any time, which will impact how we
          handle your data moving forward. If you choose to withdraw your
          consent, we will cease the collection and processing of your data for
          non-essential purposes and will take steps to delete or anonymize the
          data where feasible. This reinforces your control over your personal

          At PhotexAI, your privacy is paramount, and we are fully committed to
          protecting your personal information. One of the fundamental
          principles of our data management practices is that we do not share
          your personal data with any third parties, ensuring that your
          information remains confidential and secure within our ecosystem. This
          means that any data you provide—whether for account creation, service
          interactions, or communication purposes—is used exclusively to support
          and enhance your experience with our platform, as described in this
          Privacy Policy.<br /><br />We take extensive measures to safeguard
          your data from unauthorized access, ensuring that only our trusted
          team members and systems with a legitimate need have access to it.
          This strict access control reinforces our commitment to maintaining
          your data’s confidentiality. By keeping data processing in-house and
          avoiding external data-sharing practices, we reduce the risk of data
          exposure and maintain tighter control over how your information is
          managed. This policy helps us align with privacy laws and reinforces
          user trust, reassuring you that your personal data is never sold,
          shared, or distributed to third-party entities for marketing,
          analytics, or any other purpose outside the scope of what is stated in
          our policy. Your data stays secure, protected, and used solely for

            only those employees or personnel whose job functions require it.
            This ensures that access to sensitive information is strictly
            managed and monitored. Our access control system enforces the
            principle of "least privilege," meaning that users and systems are
            only granted the access necessary for their specific duties. Access
            logs are maintained to track and audit data handling activities,
            helping to identify and respond to any unauthorized or unusual
            access attempts promptly.

              >Data Anonymization and Pseudonymization:</strong
            >
            To enhance the security and privacy of user data, we apply
            anonymization or pseudonymization practices where feasible.
            Anonymization involves altering data in such a way that it can no
            longer be linked back to individual users without additional
            information that is stored separately. Pseudonymization, on the
            other hand, replaces personal identifiers with artificial
            identifiers or pseudonyms, allowing data processing while minimizing
            exposure of actual user identities. These techniques help to
            safeguard user data during processing, ensuring that even if data
            were to be intercepted, the risk of identifying individual users is
            significantly reduced.

            <strong class="font-bold">Infrastructure Security:</strong>
            The data stored on AWS and Cloudflare benefits from highly advanced
            security protocols designed to protect user information. These
            platforms employ network firewalls to control resource access and
            prevent unauthorized intrusions, ensuring that sensitive data is
            shielded from potential threats. Additionally, AWS and Cloudflare
            incorporate built-in threat detection and monitoring systems that
            enable swift identification and response to potential security
            incidents, enhancing overall protection. To safeguard against data
            loss, regular data backups are performed, providing redundancy and
            ensuring that services remain continuous even in the event of
            unexpected disruptions.

          <li class="pl-2">
            <strong class="font-bold">Limitations:</strong>
            Despite our strong commitment to comprehensive data protection,
            there are some current limitations in our security measures. We do
            not currently use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access to
            internal data management systems. MFA is known to add an extra layer
            of security by requiring multiple verification methods before access
            is granted, and while we recognize its importance, this remains an
            area for potential future improvement. Additionally, we do not store
            data in an encrypted format at rest, meaning that while data in
            transit is protected through encryption (e.g., TLS/SSL), stored data
            within our databases and storage solutions lacks this additional
            level of encryption. This aspect is important for users who
            prioritize full encryption throughout the data lifecycle.

        <!-- Retention of Your Data -->
        <h2 class="mb-6 text-3xl font-semibold">Retention of Your Data</h2>
        <p class="mb-16">
          At PhotexAI, we are dedicated to maintaining a responsible approach to
          data retention, ensuring that your personal information is kept only
          for as long as necessary to provide our services or comply with
          applicable legal obligations. This practice supports a balance between
          offering seamless service continuity and protecting your privacy.
          Typically, we retain your personal data for a period of 6 months or
          until you choose to delete your account, whichever comes first. This
          timeframe allows us to fulfill our service commitments to you, such as
          maintaining access to your user history, ensuring smooth reactivation
          of accounts, and enabling accurate customer support.<br /><br />Once
          the retention period has elapsed or your account is deleted, we take
          steps to securely remove or anonymize the data. Anonymized data may be
          retained beyond the typical period for analytical purposes, as it no
          longer contains personal identifiers and cannot be linked back to any
          individual. Retaining anonymized data allows us to perform valuable
          analysis, such as studying service usage trends, enhancing platform
          functionality, and improving user experience, all while protecting
          individual privacy. Our data retention policy is aligned with industry
          standards and regulatory requirements, ensuring that we handle your
          data responsibly and transparently. Should legal obligations or
          legitimate interests require an extended retention period, we will act
          in compliance with those requirements while continuing to prioritize
          data security and user rights.

        <p class="mb-16">
          At this time, we do not offer data portability in a specific format.
          Data portability refers to the ability for users to receive their
          personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable
          format, allowing them to easily transfer their information to another
          service provider if desired. While we recognize that data portability
          can be an important part of user control, this feature is not
          currently available in our services.<br /><br />The absence of data
          portability means that if you wish to transfer your data from PhotexAI
          to another platform or service, you may need to manually collect and
          re-enter your data or contact us for assistance with an alternative
          solution. Although we do not yet support automatic data transfers, we
          are committed to continually evaluating our offerings and considering

          industry standards.<br /><br />Our focus remains on safeguarding your

          Should our policy on data portability change in the future, we will
          provide clear communication and instructions on how to access and
          transfer your personal data seamlessly. We strive to be transparent
          and responsive to user needs, and we will continue exploring the
          feasibility of implementing data portability in a manner that meets
          our privacy and security standards.

        <!-- Data Transfers -->
        <h2 class="mb-6 text-3xl font-semibold">Data Transfers</h2>
        <p class="mb-16">
          While our standard data practices do not involve intentionally
          transferring user data internationally, certain circumstances may
          arise where data is accessed or processed across borders. This can
          occur when using third-party services or systems that have
          infrastructure in multiple countries or when employees or contractors
          working remotely access data from different regions. Recognizing the
          importance of protecting your data, we are committed to ensuring that
          any international data transfers are conducted in a manner that
          upholds the highest privacy standards.<br /><br />To safeguard your
          information during such transfers, we utilize internationally
          recognized legal mechanisms, such as Standard Contractual Clauses
          (SCCs). SCCs are legal tools approved by the European Commission and
          other regulatory bodies, designed to provide a consistent level of
          protection for personal data transferred from within the European
          Economic Area (EEA) to countries outside it. These clauses mandate
          that the data recipient must adhere to data protection requirements
          equivalent to those set by EU regulations, ensuring that your data
          receives the same level of security and privacy regardless of where it
          is processed.<br /><br />By implementing these safeguards, we mitigate
          the risk associated with international data transfers and align with
          global data protection frameworks, such as the General Data Protection
          Regulation (GDPR). Our commitment to using SCCs and other protective
          measures ensures that, even in the case of cross-border data movement,
          your personal information is managed with the utmost care and in
          compliance with relevant legal standards. Should international data
          transfers become a more significant part of our operations, we will
          continue to evaluate and adopt additional measures to reinforce the
          safety and integrity of your data.

          At PhotexAI, we acknowledge the importance of safeguarding the data of
          all our users, including those under the age of 18. We collect limited
          personal data from minors to provide our services effectively, but at
          present, we do not have additional, specialized safeguards designed
          explicitly for protecting the data of younger users. This means that
          the data collected from minors is managed under the same security
          measures and privacy practices as that of adult users.<br /><br />To
          further support the protection of minors, we encourage parents and
          guardians to actively oversee and guide their children's interactions
          with our platform. This involvement can help ensure that minors use
          the services responsibly and that their data privacy is maintained. We
          recommend parents educate their children about safe online practices,
          including sharing personal information and recognizing potential
          security risks.<br /><br />While our current infrastructure does not
          include child-specific privacy protections, we are committed to
          revisiting our policies regularly to align with evolving privacy
          standards and best practices for protecting younger users' data.
          Should new regulations or advancements in data protection tools
          necessitate changes to our approach, we will adapt our practices to
          better safeguard the personal information of minors. In the meantime,
          we rely on the cooperation of parents and guardians to supplement our
          efforts in maintaining a secure online environment for younger members

          involvement in protecting minors' online privacy, we currently do not
          require parental consent for users under a certain age to use our
          services. This means that minors can create accounts and interact with
          our platform independently. However, we rely on parents and guardians
          to take an active role in supervising their children's use of our
          services to ensure a safe and secure experience. We encourage parents
          to discuss responsible online behavior with their children, review
          their interactions on the platform, and guide them in making informed
          decisions when sharing personal information. Parental oversight is a
          vital supplement to our standard privacy measures, helping to create a
          safer digital environment for minors. Our commitment to transparency
          and ongoing evaluation of our policies means we remain open to

        <p class="mb-16">
          At PhotexAI, we take a focused approach to safeguarding user privacy
          by ensuring that our platform operates as a self-contained
          environment. This means that we do not incorporate or embed links to
          third-party websites, services, or applications. By keeping our
          ecosystem exclusive, we reduce the risk of exposing user data to
          external platforms that might have different privacy standards or
          practices. This design choice helps maintain tighter control over the
          data flow and security protocols, ensuring that any personal or usage
          data collected remains securely within PhotexAI's infrastructure and
          is managed according to our strict privacy guidelines.<br /><br />This
          closed-loop approach also enhances user trust by eliminating the
          uncertainties associated with data sharing that could occur when
          linking to external services. Users can confidently interact with our
          platform without concern that their data will be redirected, shared,
          or processed by third-party sites with less rigorous privacy measures.
          The absence of third-party links means that data collection and
          processing are solely conducted by PhotexAI, giving us full
          accountability over how user data is managed. Our commitment to
          keeping the user experience self-contained allows us to ensure

          Data Processing Practices for Underage Users
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-16">
          At PhotexAI, our current data processing practices apply uniformly to
          all users, including those under 18. While we have standard data
          protection measures like access controls, secure storage, and
          anonymization, we do not yet offer specialized safeguards tailored
          specifically for minors. We encourage parents and guardians to
          actively supervise their children’s interactions with our platform to
          ensure a safe and responsible online experience. This oversight helps
          protect minors and educates them on how to navigate digital spaces
          securely, including the responsible handling of personal information.
          <br /><br />We recognize that minors may have distinct privacy needs
          that could require greater protections. While PhotexAI does not
          provide child-specific content or services, we are committed to
          assessing and adapting our policies as privacy regulations and
          industry best practices evolve. Our ongoing goal is to remain aligned
          with future changes that promote enhanced data protection for younger
          users, ensuring that our platform continues to be a safe and secure
          space for everyone.
        </p>

          Protecting your privacy is central to PhotexAI’s mission, and we are

          protection practices to keep up with evolving standards, regulations,
          and technological advancements. We prioritize clear communication so
