          property rights of PhotexAI and other users. If users wish to
          reference or use any part of the platform for educational,
          journalistic, or other permissible purposes, they must seek prior
          permission from PhotexAI and provide appropriate acknowledgment where
          applicable. Violations of this policy undermine the security and
          integrity of the platform and will be dealt with according to the
          extent of the breach, ensuring protection of PhotexAI’s proprietary
          assets.

        <!-- Modifications to the Terms -->
        <h2 class="mb-6 text-3xl font-semibold">Modifications to the Terms</h2>
        <p class="mb-16">
          PhotexAI reserves the right to modify, amend, or update these Terms &
          Conditions at any time to reflect changes in our services, legal
          requirements, or business practices. Any modifications will be
          effective immediately upon posting the revised version of our
          <a
            href="https://photexai.com/usage"
            class="text-blue-500 hover:underline"
            >Usage Policy</a
          >. Users are responsible for reviewing the Terms regularly to stay
          informed about any updates.<br /><br />Notification of significant
          changes will be provided through prominent notices on the website or
          via other communication channels, such as email, to ensure users are
          aware of any revisions that may impact their use of the platform.
          Continued use of the services following the posting of modified Terms
          constitutes acceptance of those changes. If a user does not agree to
          the new terms, they must cease using the platform and may request the
          closure of their account.<br /><br />PhotexAI aims to maintain
          transparency by providing users with clear and accessible updates
          regarding changes to the Terms & Conditions. This ensures that users
          are consistently aware of their rights and obligations when using the
          platform.
        </p>
        <!-- Dispute Resolution -->
        <h2 class="mb-6 text-3xl font-semibold">Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p class="mb-16">
          Any disputes or claims arising out of or in connection with these
          Terms & Conditions, including issues relating to the use of the
          platform, user rights, or any breach of these terms, shall be resolved
          through binding arbitration or litigation, as deemed appropriate. This
          process ensures that both PhotexAI and the user engage in a fair and
          structured method of dispute resolution.<br /><br />Binding
          arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the rules of a
          recognized arbitration institution, and the decision of the arbitrator
          shall be final and binding on both parties. Arbitration proceedings
          shall be held in a mutually agreed location, or otherwise determined
          by PhotexAI, and conducted in English. By agreeing to these Terms,
          users waive the right to pursue claims in a court of law or
          participate in class action lawsuits, except as prohibited by
          applicable law.<br /><br />In cases where arbitration is not suitable
          or legally enforceable, litigation may proceed in the courts located
          in the jurisdiction stipulated under the "Governing Law" section. Both
          parties agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of these courts
          for the resolution of any disputes not resolved by arbitration.
          PhotexAI strives to settle conflicts fairly and efficiently, ensuring
          that user concerns are addressed through established, impartial
          processes.

        <!-- User Consent -->
        <h2 class="mb-6 text-3xl font-semibold">User Consent</h2>
        <p class="mb-16">

          consent includes adherence to all policies, guidelines, and any
          subsequent modifications that PhotexAI may implement. Users agree that
          their continued access and use of the platform constitutes binding
          acceptance of the terms, including any updates or changes communicated
          via the website or other official channels. By consenting, users
          commit to complying with all rules regarding platform conduct, content
          usage, and interactions with other users or third-party services.
          Furthermore, users understand that failure to comply with these terms
          may result in restricted access, suspension, or termination of their
          account. Users are encouraged to review these Terms periodically to
          stay informed about their responsibilities and any modifications that
          may affect their use of the platform. This proactive consent
          underscores the user’s role in fostering a safe and legally compliant
          environment for all participants on the platform.
        </p>
        <!-- Governing Law -->
        <h2 class="mb-6 text-3xl font-semibold">Governing Law</h2>
        <p class="mb-16">
          These Terms & Conditions, and any disputes or claims arising from
          their interpretation or use of the platform, shall be governed by and
          construed in accordance with the laws of the United States of America,
          without regard to conflict of law principles. This ensures that any
          legal questions involving PhotexAI’s services will be handled under
          U.S. law, promoting consistency and predictability in legal
          proceedings.<br /><br />Users agree that any legal actions related to
          these Terms will be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts
          specified by PhotexAI, which users accept as the appropriate venue. By
          agreeing to these Terms, users consent to the jurisdiction and
          judicial processes of U.S. courts, providing clarity and a legal
          framework for resolving any disputes.
        </p>
        <!-- Payment Terms -->
        <h2 class="mb-6 text-3xl font-semibold">Payment Terms</h2>
        <p class="mb-16">
          At present, PhotexAI’s services are offered free of charge, with no
          payment plans or associated fees required for basic usage. Users can
          access and utilize the platform’s features without incurring costs,
          fostering an inclusive environment that encourages creativity and
          participation. However, PhotexAI reserves the right to introduce
          payment plans, subscription models, or other fee-based services in the
          future as the platform evolves and expands its offerings.<br /><br />If
          and when payment options are implemented, users will be notified in
          advance, and detailed information about pricing, billing cycles, and
          payment methods will be provided. Users will have the opportunity to
          review and agree to any new payment terms before subscribing to
          fee-based services. The introduction of paid features will be
          structured to maintain transparency, ensuring users understand any
          associated costs and can make informed decisions about their use of
          the platform.<br /><br />Users who choose to engage in future paid
          services must comply with any updated payment terms, which may include
          policies related to refunds, cancellations, and billing disputes.
          PhotexAI will ensure that all payment processes are secure and
          compliant with industry standards, protecting user financial
          information and providing a reliable transactional experience.

        <!-- Service Availability -->
        <h2 class="mb-6 text-3xl font-semibold">Service Availability</h2>
        <p class="mb-16">
          PhotexAI is committed to providing reliable and continuous access to
          its services; however, users acknowledge that occasional service
          downtimes may occur due to planned maintenance, system updates, or
          unforeseen technical issues. In such instances, PhotexAI will make
          reasonable efforts to notify users in advance of planned maintenance
          or anticipated disruptions through email or other communication
          channels. For unexpected outages or technical difficulties that affect
          service availability, PhotexAI will communicate updates as promptly as
          possible, outlining the nature of the issue and any estimated
          resolution times. While PhotexAI strives to minimize disruptions and
          maintain optimal service performance, users agree that service
          interruptions may occur and that PhotexAI is not liable for any
          consequences resulting from these temporary unavailabilities.
